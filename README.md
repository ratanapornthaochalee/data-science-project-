👩🏻‍💻 Hello! My name is Ratanaporn Thaochalee, and I am a Master’s student in Data Science at Srinakharinwirot University. This repository showcases my ongoing learning journey in Data Analytics and Data Science through a team project focused on predicting the 10-year risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD).

🧠 About This Repository This project analyzes and predicts the 10-year Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) risk using data from the Framingham Heart Study (Kaggle – Heart Disease Prediction). My goal is to apply data analytics and data science techniques to explore risk factors, build predictive models, and gain insights that support early prevention strategies.

📁 Project Structure
* Data Analytics/ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering, and data visualization.
* Data Science / Machine Learning: 10 Year CHD Risk/ Model building, training, evaluation, and performance comparison across various machine learning algorithms.
* README.md Overview of the project and my role as a student and data science practitioner.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebook
* Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression)
* Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering Techniques

🎯 Objectives
* Understand key factors influencing CHD risk
* Build predictive models to estimate 10-year CHD probability
* Strengthen my skills in Data Science, Machine Learning, and health data interpretation
